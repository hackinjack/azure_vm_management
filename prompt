We are creating a python tool to generate a list of azure VMs in a given subscription, check which of them has tags "PMEnabled" and "PMEnabledDaily" and if they have value "null", set them to "true"
The service principal has sufficient privileges to perform these actions.
we are authenticating the Python tool with the Azure service principal and secret
we are not using the Azure SDK for Python to interact with the Azure resources
the tool should consider VMs across all resource groups in the subscription
the tool should also check for the existence of the "PMEnabled" and "PMEnabledDaily" tags before setting their values
the tool should update the tags on the VMs through a separate API call
the tool should log the changes made to the tags in a logfile
the tool should handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the process
